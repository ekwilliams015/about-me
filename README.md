Current

I am a senior majoring in Management Information Systems. I have lived in Maryville my whole life, and am hoping to get out as soon as I can after I graduate this May. Some of my hobbies include video games, weightlifting, and bowling. I also am a huge Kansas City Chiefs fan and am ready to hopefully not be disappointed again this weekend. 

Future

For my plans after I graduate, I plan to live with my parents and save money until I find a job I like. I do not have any specific job aspirations, I would like to test the waters with different companies until I find my niche (or whatever pays best).
